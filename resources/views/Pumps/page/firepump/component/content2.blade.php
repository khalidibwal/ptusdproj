                            <h3>Vertical shaft, turbine type centrifugal fire pumps have submerged impellers contained in a series-bowl assembly at the bottom of a vertical shaft. The design is similar to pumps used extensively for industrial and municipal service. These pumps are FM Approved for discharging water from lakes, streams, open sumps, drilled wells and other equivalent subsurface sources. Each pump consists of a discharge head, motor stand, column pipe, line shaft, bowl assembly and suction strainer. For electric drive, FM Approved pumps must be used with a vertical, electric motor. For internal-combustion-engine drive, FM Approved pumps must be connected to the FM Approved engine through an FM Approved right-angle gear drive.</h3>
