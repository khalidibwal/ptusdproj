                            The Aire-O2 Microfloat  unit has a specially 
                            designed non-clog spinning propeller disc that creates extremely fine micro bubbles (10-50 microns in diameter). Oil particles and suspended solids in the wastewater readily attach to the bubbles as they rise to the surface. The small bubble size results in very high removal efficiencies. Many applications do not require any chemical addition for superior treatment. 
                            The Microfloat is manufactured by Aeration Industries 
                            International, a recognized global leader in wastewater treatment. The Company has installations throughout the United States and more than 92 countries around the world.
