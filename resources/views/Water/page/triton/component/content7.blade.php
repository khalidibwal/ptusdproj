                            The Aire-O2 Triton  process aeratorâ€™s unique design 
                            and compact size eliminate the need for huge capital equipment expenditures and upfront installation costs. Since the Triton aerator provides both the mixing and aeration in one unit and is installed directly in a tank, there is a substantial savings in both equipment supply and installation perspectives versus conventional designs utilizing diffused air. The cost of diffuser heads, piping networks and supports, centrifugal or positive displace- ment blowers, and blower buildings or enclosures is eliminated and replaced by the Triton process 
                            aerator/mixer at a much lower capital cost. The result is a much more compact plant that is quicker to install and easier to operate and maintain.
