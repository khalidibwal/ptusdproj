                            Since the surface-mounted process aerator drives air deep into a tank or oval by its power mix propeller, this minimizes aerosols or splashing of potentially harmful environmental concerns such as pathogens in the air and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The subsurface aeration also reduces noise making the aerators an environmentally and community-friendly choice.  
“The Tritons don’t splash or throw any wastewater into the air”, reports Steve Mier of St. Augustine WWTP.  “The water stays in the tank even on windy days.” He adds, “Working around the disks on windy days can get kind of nasty with the wastewater splashing.”
