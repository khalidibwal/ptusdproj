                        <ul>
    <li>The Triton aerator/mixers eliminate diffusers and associated air piping networks, mixers, blowers, blower buildings, and enclosures.</li>
    <li>The Triton's ability to operate in either the 'mixing + aeration' or 'mixing only' mode by simply cycling the unit's blower on and off allows for better process control and flexibility, making it very easy to integrate nitrification/denitrification cycles and to facilitate biological phosphorus removal.</li>
    <li>Gear-driven four-sided stainless steel decanter with solids exclusion weir ensures a controlled high-quality effluent.</li>
    <li>Tested and proven controls package.</li>
    <li>Mixing and aeration equipment is surface mounted allowing for ease of inspection and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Powerful vertical and horizontal mixing provided by the Triton units allows for deep basin designs, reducing plant footprint.</li>
    <li>Multi-reactor Batch and Single-reactor Continuous Flow designs available.</li>
    <li>Aire-O2 Triton units come with a standard 3-year mechanical warranty.</li>
