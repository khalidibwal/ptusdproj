                            The electric motor (2) is the heart of the machine and is located above the high- 
                            density spray-diffusion zone to minimize its exposure to the nature and contents 
                            of the pumped l iquid. The motors are weatherproof to IP56 ingress protection 
                            (dust + powerful waterjet), are chemical service capable, 7 TEFC 
                            (Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled) 3 phase. These motors utilize 
                            a “labyrinth” type bearing seal for maximum protection against water spray.
                            The Impeller (8) is constructed of stainless steel and is manufactured using the machine-pitch process which assures perfect accuracy and top performance. The impeller pitch is designed 
                            for maximum hydraulic delivery without overloading the motor.
