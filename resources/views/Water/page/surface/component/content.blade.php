                            The Aire-O2 Halo Surface Aerator has joined the family of products at Aeration Industries. This splasher aerator is designed to maximize the two most important functions of any aeration device: oxygen transfer and mixing. The all-new Aire-O2    Halo  efficiently pumps basin water through the unit in a manner which creates a highly efficient spray pattern for introducing oxygen into the liquid. At the same time, this pumping action insures complete mixing and efficient oxygen dispersion. At Aeration Industries, our years of experience in design and application of surface mounted mechanical aeration equipment have been combined with the full capabilities of our extensive research testing at our facility in Chaska, MN. This enables us to provide a splasher aerator which not only maximizes oxygen transfer and mixing characteristics, but perform these function in the most economical and reliable manner
