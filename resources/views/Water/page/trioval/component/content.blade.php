                            The dNOx System controls operation of the Aire-O2 
                            Triton  aerators in the Tri-Oval ditch by automatically 
                            turning the Triton blowers on and off as dictated by a 
                            proprietary controls algorithm.  This regulates oxygen 
                            and ORP levels in the ditch while the Triton mixers are 
                            kept in operation to maintain solids suspension for optimum treatment.  
                            The control system detects two inflection points that appear on the ORP 
                            curve upon completion of nitrification (P1) and completion of denitrification 
                            (P2) providing precise detection of these process points.  
                            Operation in this manner ensures a sufficient volume of aeration for removal of organic matter and nitrogen resulting in a high nitrogen and BOD removal ratio while allowing for optimal anoxic periods to maximize removal of nitrates.
