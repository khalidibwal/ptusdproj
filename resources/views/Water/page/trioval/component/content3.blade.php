                            The Tri-Oval  System provides unsurpassed control of the 
                            activated sludge process matched with the cost saving benefits of simplified design, installation, and operation. What 
                            makes this possible is our unique, patented Aire-O2 TritonÂ® process aerator/mixer that drives fine bubble aeration and complete mixing as deep as 33 feet (10 meters). This means we can build a deeper oval with a much smaller footprint and still treat the same volume of wastewater.
                            Using Aire-O2 Triton  technology, aeration and 
                            mixing horsepower are divided between multiple process aerators providing for inherent equipment redundancy and power distribution around the ditch. This greatly simplifies operations and maximizes treatment efficiency and process control capabilities.
